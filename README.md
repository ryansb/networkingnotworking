Net-working not-working?

*Try networknotwork!!*

It's the networking library that does no useful work. It provides
implementations of internet protocols that help nobody with anything.

Highlights include:

* Discard Protocol: RFC 863, a network equivalent of /dev/null

* CHARGEN: RFC 864, provides unlimited numbers of ASCII characters.

* QOTD: RFC 865, a 512 character or less quote of the day
